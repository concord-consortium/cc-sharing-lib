2. `SharinatorPublish`
    * User intiated request for new data.
3. `SharinatorPublishResponse`

## To Build: ##
1. Install dependencies: `yarn`
2. Compile `npm run build`


## Running the demo & tester app ##

You can view an [online demo](http://sharing-demo.concord.org/branch/master/demo.html).

Deployment happens automagically using travis and `branch/<branchname>` urls.
Production branch goes to [http://sharing-demo.concord.org/demo.html](http://sharing-demo.concord.org/branch/master/demo.html)

## Running a local demo & tester app ##
(This process could use some improvement â€¦  )

1. Compile `npm run build`
1. from the root director run `live-server .`
2. navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8080/src/demo/demo.html](http://127.0.0.1:8080/src/demo/demo.html)

If you want to work on the demo, then you can hack on files in  `src/demo/*` while running `webpack --watch` and keep `live-server` running,.
